## Micro-Lessons: Building Positive First Experiences in New Software Carpentry Instructors

### Overview

It has been observed that a large fraction of people completing Software Carpentry (SWC) Instructor Training haven't yet taught a workshop, possibly due in part to the need for better outreach to hosts to encourage them to request a workshop. Furthermore, a great deal of the anonymous minute-card feedback collected after live Instructor Training events recently has reported misgivings felt by students on their level of familiarity with SWC material, and a lack of confidence that they were ready to teach an entire unit at a full workshop. To address both these concerns, we'd like to give new instructors an opportunity to participate in a smaller, guided teaching experience that serves as a stepping stone to a full workshop, and simultaneously provides potential hosts with a short preview of what a SWC workshop is like, in order to build interest and outreach.

Therefore, the Mentorship Committee proposes a new program of Micro-Lessons, to serve the pool of new instructors as they graduate from Instructor Training. A Micro-Lesson is characterized by the following:

- The Micro-Lesson should deliver the first few sections of a unit of existing SWC material, to promote instructor familiarity with the material and mitigate additional content maintenance costs.
- A Micro-Lesson should be about 1-1.5 hours in length, and certainly not longer than a full SWC unit.
- Instructors are encouraged to deliver their Micro-Lesson in a familiar & safe setting; to their research group, as a seminar in their department, or among any group of peers they feel comfortable with.
- The Micro-Lesson should be observed by a more experienced SWC instructor, in order to provide feedback and support. Ideally, the mentor-instructor should be available live at the lesson, but practicality will sometimes require they watch by video stream.

Upon completing a Micro-Lesson, the new instructor will:

- Have initiated a pattern of success in teaching that will reinforce their confidence to teach a full workshop unit.
- Have increased their familiarity with some of the SWC lesson material.
- Be eligible for badging as a full instructor, at the discretion of the observing instructor. This option is proposed by the Mentorship Committee as an alternative to the previous requirement of co-teaching a full workshop with an experienced instructor, to alleviate the challenges this posed for new instructors in communities far from our existing instructor base.

### Program Engagement

While any instructor may deliver a Micro-Lesson, this program is especially suited to instructors just completing Instructor Training (live or online). The Mentorship Committee recommends presenting this option to all new Instructor Training graduates, and following up with it again after 6 months for all those new instructors who have not yet taught & completed their badge.

Furthermore, the Mentorship Committee points out the opportunity for outreach provided by the Micro-Lesson program. By providing short, no-cost and low-overhead 'samples' of SWC teaching, curriculum and methodology, we create the opportunity for prospective host institutions to try out the format before organizing a full workshop.

### Metrics

The Micro-Lesson program lends itself to some simple metrics:

- Fraction of new instructors choosing a Micro-Lesson as their path to getting their full badge: indicates popularity and relevance of the program to the instructor community.
- Fraction of Micro-Lessons that convert into full workshops: indicates the appeal of the SWC model to hosts based on real experience.

### To-Do

In order for the Micro-Lesson program to deliver compelling lessons, the Mentorship Committee recommends identifying curriculum that can likely be taught successfully in 1-1.5 hours, and deliver a useful skill or result in that time. At least one such subset of each of the Python, R, Git and Shell lessons should be identified before moving ahead with the program at scale.
