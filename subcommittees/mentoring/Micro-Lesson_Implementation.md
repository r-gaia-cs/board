## Implementation Support Plan for Micro-lesson

Below is an implementation support plan for the proposed Micro-Lesson to be taught by 
those who have completed the free/open online instructor training during 2015 Fall-Winter.
The micro-lesson assignment outlined it to be done after instructor training has been completed.

### Mentor Requirements
Estimating an average of 80 people completing instructor training.
The program outlined below will require, at minimum, 8 Mentors
(Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry Instructors who have taught 3 or more lessons in the previous 12 months).
Each Mentor will be responsible for a maximum of 10 individuals who have recently completed instructor 
training, herein referred to as trainees. For this program to be successful, each Mentor 
will have to commit a maximum of ~30 hours over 3 months
(see the table at the end of this document). 

### Micro-lesson topic requirements
The trainees assigned to each mentor will focus their micro-lesson on the same topic
that need to be in Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry currículum
to enhance the peer learning potential.
Trainees micro-lessons will be one hour long.

### General Program outline
1. Trainees will make a Github repository called `SWC-Micro-lesson-TheirName`. Two weeks 
before the trainee is to teach the Micro-lesson, they must push a Markdown version of 
their lesson plan and the data required to teach it to the repository, as well as send a 
seasoned instructor, herein referred to as Mentor, the `url` to this repository.

2. The Mentor then must review the lesson plan and have a 15 minute Google hangout meeting
with each Trainee one week before the Trainee is scheduled to teach the Micro-lesson. In
addition to the remote meeting, the Mentor may also suggest changes to the lesson plan 
via Issues or Pull Requests to the Trainees Github repository for the Micro-lesson.

3. The Trainee teaches the 1 hr Micro-lesson, in person, to a minimum of 1 other 
individual while the Mentor observes either in person, or remotely. 

4. Immediately after the Micro-lesson, the Trainee and Mentor engage in an 15 minute 
one-on-one debrief where the Mentor first asks the Trainee to comment on their 
performance. After which, the Mentor can give additional feedback on the Trainees 
performance.

5. One week after the last Trainee has completed teaching their Micro-lesson, the Mentor 
and their trainees will meet together for a 1 hour debrief via Google Hangouts. The Mentor 
will also make an Etherpad notepad for the meeting and ask the Trainees to before the 
meeting, answer the questions written below. At the meeting the Mentor will ask the 
students to share their answers verbally to the questions with the other trainees and 
facilitate a discussion of their experiences between the Trainees.

6. Trainees will make a suggested revision/edit/addition (e.g. new challenge question) to
the Software Carpentry repository of the lesson topic they taught. They will tag the 
Mentor in their Pull Request to demonstrate that this has been done.

### Questions to ask at the group debrief:

* How many learners? 
* What topic was taught? 
* What specifically was taught (i.e. to what part of the lesson did you get to)?
* Did you adapt the lesson material or use it as written?
* Please describe the challenges you used.
* Were there any installation problems??
* What worked well that you should do again?
* What went wrong / fell flat / that you would not ever want to do again?
* Anything else that might be interesting.

### Mentors' Contribution Time Estimation Table

|Activity|Duration Estimation|Quantity|
|Review lesson notes|0:15|Number of trainees|
|Meeting pre mini-lesson|0:15|Number of trainees|
|Watch mini-lesson|1:00|Number of trainees|
|Individual debriefing|0:15|Number of trainees|
|Group debriefing|1:00|1|
|Review pull request|0:15|Number of trainees|

**Total**: `Number of trainees` × 2 + 1.
